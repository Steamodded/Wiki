# Calculating Objects
Objects can have a `calculate` function defined on them to allow them to react to different events happening in the game. The main time for this to happen is during **scoring**, but there are other contexts that the game calculates effects. There is a full list of contexts available at the end of this guide.

## Creating a Calculate Function
To create a calculate function on your object, add this code to your object definition.
```lua
calculate = function(self, card, context)
	-- calculation code goes in here
end,
```
In this function, `self` refers to the center object that is used to create cards of this type, `card` refers to the actual card you are calculating on, and `context` refers to the table of values sent to the calculate. You will need to use `card` and `context` to calculate any effects within your object.
There are three steps to writing the calculation code within your function.
1. Checking for the correct context
2. Any logic/effects you want to do
3. Returning any effects that need to be handled

### Step 1: Context Checks
All code within your calculate function should be inside a **context check**. This statement will ensure that your effect will open happen in the timing that you want it to happen. There is a full list of contexts at the end of this guide, but here are some common ones you might want to use.
- `if context.joker_main then` The main scoring timing of jokers
- `if context.cardarea == G.play and context.main_scoring` The main scoring of played cards *(used for modifiers to cards)*
- `if context.before then` For effects that happen in the scoring loop but before anything is scored
- `if context.final_scoring_step then`For effects that modify the score after all cards have been scored
- `if context.cardarea == G.play and context.repetition then` For adding repetitions to played cards

### Step 2: Logic/Effects
In this step, you need to add your actual logic for calculation. Values that are defined in your object's config can be access by using `card.ability.`, for example, here is some code that increases the chips an object will give out by 10 every time the effect is evaluated.
```lua
card.ability.extra.chips = card.ability.extra.chips + card.ability.extra.chip_gain
```

### Step 3: Returning Effects
Any effects that you want to be evaluated will need to be returned in a table. To score the chips from Step 2, you should use this return table.
```lua
return {
	chips = card.ability.extra.chips
}
```
There are a range of different keys that you can return in this table.
- `chips`,`mult`,`xmult`, `dollars` - scores these values *(automatically adds a message to the card that is being scored)*
- `swap` - swaps current chips and mult values with each other
- `level_up` - levels up the played hand by the number returned
- `saved` - used during `context.end_of_round` to prevent game over
- `message` - used to return a custom message
	- will automatically be put on the scored card unless `message_card` is also returned
	- colour of message background will be `G.C.FILTER` unless `colour` is returned
	- sound will be `generic1` unless `sound` is returned
- `func` - return a function to be called at the correct timing *(advanced)*
- `extra` - an extra table set out the same as this one *(advanced)*

If you do not want the default messages to be shown when adding `chips` etc. there are 2 ways around this
1. Use `remove_default_message = true` in your return table to ignore the message completely
2. Use `chip_message = 'text'` to change the text *(this maintains default timings)*
___
Putting all this together, we get the following function that will increment chips each time the object is scored, and then score the new amount of chips.
```lua
calculate = function(self, card, context)
	if context.joker_main then
		card.ability.extra.chips = card.ability.extra.chips + card.ability.extra.chip_gain
		return {
			chips = card.ability.extra.chips
		}
	end
end
```
Here is another example for a Joker that increases the amount of mult it gives when you play a Flush.
```lua
calculate = function(self, card, context)
	-- Check if we have played a Flush before we do any scoring and increment the chips
	if context.before and next(context.poker_hands['Flush']) then
		card.ability.extra.mult = card.ability.extra.mult + card.ability.extra.mult_gain
		return {
			message = 'Upgraded!',
			colour = G.C.RED
		}
	end
	-- Add the chips in main scoring context
	if context.joker_main then
		return {
			mult = card.ability.extra.mult
		}
	end
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to evaluate effects outside of the return table, use `SMODS.calculate_effect({effects}, card)`,
> where `{effects}` is a table like the return table of a calculate function, and `card` is the card that is being evaluated.

## Contexts
Detailed here is a list of all contexts that are sent to calculate functions, as well as a unique identifier to use to reference them. As each context is sent to different areas, use the following logic statement to make sure you are calculating in the intended area.
```lua
if context.cardarea == G.play then -- replace G.play with G.jokers/G.hand as appropriate
```
---
