# The `G` Variable

Balatro has a global variable `G` which is the singleton instance of the `Game` class. This list is not comprehensive.

## The Highlights

- `G.E_MANAGER` is the [event manager](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/Guide-%E2%80%90-Event-Manager).
- `G.P_CENTERS` holds the game's center objects (prototypes for jokers, consumables, vouchers, decks, enhancements, editions, and boosters). It is indexed with the object's key. For example, `G.P_CENTERS.c_strength` is the center for Strength.
- `G:update(dt)` is called once per frame. This uses `G.STATE` and `G.STATE_COMPLETE` to run a state machine.
- `G.C` holds colors.
- [`G.GAME`](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/G#GGAME)
